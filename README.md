# Nexspro Backend â€“ Rails API for Developer Platform

This is the backend API for my personal developer platform **Nexspro**.

Built with **Ruby on Rails**, it powers all data, authentication, and content logic used by the frontend interface.

##  Technologies

- **Ruby on Rails 7** (API mode)
- **PostgreSQL** (database)
- **Rodauth** with JWT (authentication)
- **Blueprinter** (JSON serialization)
- Tested with RSpec, FactoryBot, and Shoulda Matchers

##  Features

- Account creation, login, logout, JWT token system
- Admin and user roles
- Endpoints for projects, skills, clients, news posts, and releases
- Clean, modular API structure
- Connected to a Next.js frontend

##  Goal

This backend was built to support a modern developer portfolio site.  
It reflects my ability to structure a scalable API, implement secure authentication, and manage real-world data models in production.
